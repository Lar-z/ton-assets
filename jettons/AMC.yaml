name: AMC
description: American movie classics its in the same category as GME. In the united states it is a stock that made alot of middle class people rich because of an amazing rally created by a man named keith gill also known as roaring kitty. Created a diamond hand culture and they went to the moon and made a lot of rich people mad. Since then he's been silent, for 3 years. yesterday he started tweeting again and both GME and AMC are flying again. Some speculate his posts are hinting at a switch to AMC for the main reason of coming back this time.
